## Plant Disease Classification System

CropDex is an advanced crop disease classification system that uses computer vision and machine learning to identify plant diseases from images. The system not only predicts the most likely disease affecting your crops but also provides alternative possibilities when the image clarity is insufficient, along with comprehensive descriptions to help farmers take appropriate action.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Disease Identification**: Upload images of diseased crops and get instant identification
- **Confidence Levels**: View prediction confidence to understand reliability
- **Alternative Suggestions**: See other potential diseases when images are ambiguous
- **Detailed Descriptions**: Get comprehensive information about each detected disease
- **Multi-language Support**: Available in 12 regional languages to serve diverse farming communities
- **Voice Summaries**: Listen to disease information with integrated text-to-speech functionality

## üîç Supported Crops & Diseases

CropDex currently supports identification of various diseases in common crops including:
- Tomato (Early Blight, Late Blight, Leaf Mold, etc.)
- Potato (Early Blight, Late Blight, etc.)
- And many more...

We are actively working to expand our database with more plants and higher quality images for improved accuracy.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Deep Learning**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for image classification
- **Frontend**: Streamlit for an interactive and user-friendly interface
- **Language Support**: Built-in support for 12 regional languages
- **Audio**: Integrated text-to-speech for voice summaries of disease information

## üìä Model Performance

Our CNN model has been trained on thousands of images of plant diseases and achieves:
- 95%+ accuracy on clear images
- Intelligent confidence scoring for uncertain predictions
- Regular updates to improve performance across different crop varieties
